I have deprecated this version of CSim in favour of a new approach which narrows the scope of the project to simply generating
executable functions from CellML models. See http://get.readthedocs.org/ for some information and https://github.com/nickerso/csim
the new code base.

This version of the code is no longer being maintained. The CVode example in the new CSim code base should provide most of the 
functionality that was available in this version of CSim (https://github.com/nickerso/csim/tree/master/examples/cvode-integrator).

Instructions on using CSim are available under the CSim wiki at: http://code.google.com/p/cellml-simulator/w/.
